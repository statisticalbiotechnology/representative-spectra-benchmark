== General Description of the project

The pipeline used to analyze the data can be found here (Figure 1), in summary:

* The original spectra of the datasets (PXD004732, PXD007058) using the MSGF+.
* The spectra is clustered using MaRa-Cluster and Spectra-Cluster (formally known as PRIDE cluster).
* For each cluster, a consensus spectra is generated using the following algorithms:
   ** Best spectrum
   ** Binning spectrum
   ** Average spectrum
   ** Most similar spectrum

== Dataset 1: PXD004732

From PRIDE dataset PXD004732 [PubMed: 28135259], 10 Raw files were used. In summary, this dataset was generated using the following sample protocol: Tryptic peptides were individually synthesized by solid phase synthesis, combined into pools of ~1,000 peptides and measured on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. For each peptide pool, an inclusion list was generated to target peptides for fragmentation in further LC-MS experiments using five fragmentation methods (HCD, CID, ETD, EThCD, ETciD ) with ion trap or Orbitrap readout and HCD spectra were recorded at 6 different collision energies.

Note:: More details can be seen in the document https://github.com/ypriverol/specpride/blob/dev/results/identification-results-v4.3.xlsx[identification-results-4.3.xlsx]

In order to compare different algorithms we will discuss two metrics (number of Peptides and number of PSms identified ), in the Supplementary information we also have additional metrics like:

** Number of Unique Peptide Sequences
** Number of PSMs
** Number of Proteins
** The ratio of No.PSMs/No. MS

=== Some remarks and conclusions

* Non of the included combinations of cluster algorithm + consensus spectra generation methof performs better that searching for all the MS/MS spectra.

[NOTE]
====
**@jgriss** mentioned that most of the algorithms previously published already found this issue, we should probably found some citations to discussion and reference the original papers.
====

* The Most similar spectrum, consistently provides for all the RAw files the higher number of peptides. While the higher number of PSMs varies across files and methods between **Spectrum average** and **Spectrum bin**

[NOTE]
====
We really need to find a way to discuss this, I rally think that we don't observed major differences between methods in the number of PSMs, all then only have less 1% difference in the number of PSMs.
====

* In all cases, MaRa Cluster provides more Identifications and PSMs than PRIDE Cluster.

[NOTE]
====
As I mentioned in  https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/representative-spectra-benchmark/issues/56[this issue], I don't want to benchmark the results of clustering algorithms. I would like to focus the discussion about the consensus spectra generation methods. However, we can mentioned this. You can find more discussion about the starting clustering results in the https://github.com/ypriverol/specpride/blob/dev/results/supplement.docx[following document]

== Dataset 2: PXD007058

In the dataset PXD007058 [PubMed:28741359], the authors compare and contrast eight MS acquisition methods on the novel tribrid Orbitrap Fusion MS platform, using both a synthetic phosphopeptide library and a complex phosphopeptide-enriched cell lysate. As well as evaluating multiple fragmentation regimes (HCD, EThcD and neutral loss triggered ET(ca/hc)D), and analyzers for MS/MS (orbitrap (OT) versus ion trap (IT)).

We used 3 raw files from the experiment to detect major differences in the identification of phosphorilated peptides when clustering is applied before database search.

=== Some remarks and conclusions

* Excepting best method, the correct rate (including bin, most, average method) is over 67%. In PRIDE, the correct rate is higher. The correct rate in best mothed is approximately 55%.

* No major differences are observed on phosphorilation analysis.

[NOTE]
====
The gross of peptides identified is relatively small. Similarly, the MaxQuant results that downloading from PRIDE archive is also small
